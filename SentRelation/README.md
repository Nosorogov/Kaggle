# Contradictory, my Dear Watson

If you have two sentences, there are three ways they could be related: one could entail the other, one could contradict the other, or they could be unrelated.
There is NLI model that assigns labels of 0, 1, or 2 (corresponding to entailment, neutral, and contradiction) to pairs of premises and hypotheses. To make things more interesting, the train and test set include text in fifteen different languages.
